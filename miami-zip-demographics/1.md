Yesterday I had the good fortune of having the noted author [Alberto Cairo](https://twitter.com/albertocairo) sign up for my new free email course [Learn to Map Census Data in R](http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2015/06/25/learn-to-map-census-data-in-r/). Alberto's simple tweet brought a ton of traffic to my blog and course. As a token of my appreciation, I decided to do something nice for him. 

From his twitter profile it appears that Alberto lives in Miami, Florida. So I decided to make him a web app that lets you explore the demographic statistics of the Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach [Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area). The app is built using R's [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) framework. You can see source code HERE.
