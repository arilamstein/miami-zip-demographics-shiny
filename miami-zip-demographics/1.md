Yesterday the noted author Alberto Cairo [tweeted](https://twitter.com/albertocairo/status/614392894762266624) about my new free course [Learn to Map Census Data in R](http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2015/06/25/learn-to-map-census-data-in-r/). This simple tweet wound up introducing my course to a brand new audience. As a token of my appreciation, I decided to do something nice for him. 

From his twitter profile it appears that Alberto lives in Miami, Florida. So I decided to make a web app that lets you explore the demographics of the Miami [Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area). The app is built using R's [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) framework. You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/arilamstein/miami-zip-demographics-shiny).

The regions you see here are [Zip Code Tabulated Areas (ZCTAS)](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/zctas.html), which is the US Census Bureau's approximation of Zip Codes. The data comes from the 2013 [American Community Survey (ACS)](http://www.census.gov/acs/www/). 

If you are interested in creating visualizations like this yourself, sign up for my free email course [Learn to Map Census Data in R](http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2015/06/25/learn-to-map-census-data-in-r/).
